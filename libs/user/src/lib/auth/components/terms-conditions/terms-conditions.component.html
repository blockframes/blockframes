              6.2. The financing of a Project is conducted by the Users under their sole liability and corresponding

              are concluded by Users offline. Accordingly, Users are the sole Parties liable for their use of the
              Service and for the

              such Investor
              at its own risk. It is consequently the Investor’s responsibility to check the accuracy and completeness
              of any Project

              the case may
              be, to have full right to publish it on the Platform. The User Professional Content Financier is free to
              determine,
              under its sole responsibility, the level of confidentiality applicable to the Project Information made
              available on the
              Platform. It is aware that when it publishes confidential Project Information, it does so at its own risk,
              CASCADE 8
              having no way to control the use and further disclosure of the confidential Project Information by any
              other User.
              The User Professional Content Financier holds CASCADE 8 harmless from any action, claim, suit or
              proceeding resulting
              from incorrect, incomplete, confidential or inapplicable Projects Information, in case the publication of
              any such
              Projects Information by CASCADE 8 violates or infringes any rights from a third party.
              <br>
              6.4. The User Investor declares and acknowledges that it will use the Project Information made available
              to it
              exclusively and specifically for the purpose of assessing whether or not it wishes to invest in the
              financing of such
              Project. No other use is authorized, notably any diffusion, display, copy, upload, modification and / or
              transmission,
              to any third party.
              <br>
              Moreover, the User Investor is aware that some of the Project Information, if marked as “Confidential”
              shall not be
              disclosed outside the Platform. The User Investor may be held liable for any such disclosure infringing
              the T&Cs and its
              consequences towards CASCADE 8 and the concerned Professional Content Financier.
              You will be informed of such confidentiality at the time You access the concerned Project Information by a
              confidentiality disclaimer that You will have to accept before reaching said Project Information. Your
              acceptance shall,
              as a consequence, be a proof of the confidentiality undertaking You are accepting towards the Professional
              Content
              Financier.

              pornographic,

              animal; (v) promotes illegal or harmful activities or substances; or (vi) violates the hereby T&Cs.
              CASCADE 8 may,
              without prior notice, remove or disable access to any content that CASCADE 8 finds to be in violation of
              applicable law,
