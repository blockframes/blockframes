              the case may
              be, to have full right to publish it on the Platform. The User Professional Content Financier is free to
              determine,
              under its sole responsibility, the level of confidentiality applicable to the Project Information made

              Platform. It is aware that when it publishes confidential Project Information, it does so at its own risk,

              proceeding resulting
              from incorrect, incomplete, confidential or inapplicable Projects Information, in case the publication of
              any such
              Projects Information by CASCADE 8 violates or infringes any rights from a third party.
              <br>
              6.4. The User Investor declares and acknowledges that it will use the Project Information made available
              to it
              exclusively and specifically for the purpose of assessing whether or not it wishes to invest in the
              financing of such
              Project. No other use is authorized, notably any diffusion, display, copy, upload, modification and / or
              transmission,
              to any third party.
              <br>
              Moreover, the User Investor is aware that some of the Project Information, if marked as Confidential
              shall not be
              disclosed outside the Platform. The User Investor may be held liable for any such disclosure infringing
              the T&Cs and its
              consequences towards CASCADE 8 and the concerned Professional Content Financier.
              You will be informed of such confidentiality at the time You access the concerned Project Information by a
              confidentiality disclaimer that You will have to accept before reaching said Project Information. Your
              acceptance shall,
              as a consequence, be a proof of the confidentiality undertaking You are accepting towards the Professional
              Content

              CASCADE 8 may,
              without prior notice, remove or disable access to any content that CASCADE 8 finds to be in violation of
              applicable law,

                <p>
                  Il se peut que Vous soyez déjà un Utilisateur ayant accès à la Solution 
                  selon l'Abonnement de l'Organisation dont Vous faites partie. Si ce n'est pas le 
                  cas, Vous recevrez une invitation d'un autre Utilisateur via Votre adresse email 
                  qui Vous permettra de Vous inscrire. L'équipe CASCADE8 Vous permettra de créer Votre 
                  propre profil et d'accéder à la Solution à sa discrétion après vérification de Votre 
                  identité. L'équipe CASCADE8 peut exiger que l'Organisation dont Vous faites partie 
                  obtienne d'abord un Abonnement. Dans tous les cas, Vous serez lié à une Organisation 
                  qui aura son propre profil. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  La création d'un profil nécessite de compléter toutes les informations obligatoires 
                  et d'accepter les CGU mises à disposition ainsi que la Politique de Confidentialité 
                  de CASCADE8 (voir article 9).
                </p>
                <h4>2.3. Dans les deux cas :</h4>
                <p>
                  Votre profil peut être complété par des informations supplémentaires. Toutes les 
                  informations personnelles collectées et traitées sont couvertes par la Politique de 
                  Confidentialité que Vous trouverez  à l'article 9 ci-dessous. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Lorsque Vous complétez et enregistrez Votre profil ou celui de Votre Organisation 
                  Cliente, Vous déclarez et garantissez que Vous avez le pouvoir d'engager légalement 
                  cette Organisation Cliente et Vous Vous engagez à fournir des informations exactes, 
                  actuelles et mises à jour tout au long de la procédure d'enregistrement et à maintenir 
                  à tout moment les informations de Votre page de profil à jour. Vous avez le choix de 
                  décider, à tout moment, si Vous voulez ou non garder confidentielles certaines de Vos 
                  Données Personnelles de Votre profil. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  La création d'un profil implique l'acceptation pleine et entière des présentes CGU, qui 
                  est confirmée en cliquant sur « J'accepte par la présente les CGU de Blockframes ». Les 
                  CGU sont mises à la disposition de tout Utilisateur au moment de l'inscription. Vous 
                  pouvez imprimer ou sauvegarder les CGU après les avoir lues. CASCADE8 se réserve le 
                  droit de modifier les CGU à tout moment. Dans ce cas, CASCADE8 pourra en informer tout 
                  Utilisateur par courrier électronique ou lors de sa première connexion à la Solution 
                  après la modification des CGU. L'utilisation du Service après toute modification 
                  vaudra acceptation des nouvelles CGU. Tout Utilisateur devra informer CASCADE8 par 
                  email en cas de non-acceptation. Les Utilisateurs qui acceptent les CGU sous réserve, 
                  ou qui n'acceptent pas les CGU, ne peuvent plus accéder à la Solution ou utiliser le 
                  Service.  Tout Utilisateur peut décider de fermer son profil à tout moment en envoyant 
                  un courrier électronique à CASCADE8. Si une Organisation Cliente décide de fermer son 
                  propre profil, tous les profils des Utilisateurs Clients qui lui sont rattachés seront 
                  automatiquement fermés par CASCADE8 au même moment. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Tout manquement grave d'un Utilisateur Client à l'une de ses obligations au titre des 
                  CGU, non réparé dans un délai de quinze (15) jours à compter de la réception d'une 
                  lettre recommandée avec accusé de réception ou d'un courrier électronique avec accusé 
                  de réception de la part de CASCADE8, lui permettra de suspendre ou de révoquer les 
                  Identifiants de Connexion de l'Utilisateur Client concerné, en fonction de la gravité 
                  des faits, ou d'interdire l'utilisation du Service, le cas échéant. La lettre ou l'email 
                  précisera les faits reprochés. En outre, tout accès de l'Utilisateur Client concerné 
                  aux fonctionnalités du Service sera impossible, sans préjudice de tous autres dommages 
                  et intérêts auxquels CASCADE8 pourrait prétendre. En cas de trouble ou d'infraction 
                  manifestement illicite, le délai pour y remédier pourra être plus court.

                  En acceptant les CGU, Vous autorisez CASCADE8 à publier sur la Solution les informations

                  autres Utilisateurs et à permettre aux autres Utilisateurs de Vous contacter.
