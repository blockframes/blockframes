            <h3>2 – Creating and closing a profile</h3>
            <p>
              To use the Service, You must create Your own profile and join a Company. Your profile has to be linked
              with
              the
              profile of Your Company. To do so, You have two options: create directly Your profile online or be invited
              by a
              Company to join it and create Your profile. To create directly Your profile, You need to access the
              Website,
              verify if
              Your Company has already a profile by searching its name into the search field. If so, You can click on
              the
              profile of
              Your Company and send it a request to join the Company. If the Company has not yet a profile, You have to
              send to
              CASCADE 8 a request to add the Company as a User. As its own discretion, CASCADE 8 may decide to create
              the
              profile of
              the Company. After the creation of the profile of the Company by CASCADE 8, or after the Company has
              accepted Your
              request to join it, You must complete all compulsory information, notably regarding Your first name,
              surname, email
              address, telephone number, profile picture and position within the Company. The profile of the Company has
              to be
              completed with the following compulsory information: Company’s name, address, telephone number, email
              address,
              activity, fiscal number and logo. When You are registering a profile for a Company, You represent and
              warrant that You
              have the authority to legally bind that Company. When creating Your profile, You undertake to provide
              accurate,
              current and update information during the registration process and keep Your profile page information
              up-to-date at
              all times. Creation of a profile implies full acceptance of the present T&Cs, which is confirmed by
              clicking
              on
              “Accept the T&Cs” when creating a profile. The T&Cs are made available to any User when creating a
              profile,
              before
              finalising the profile and the aforementioned acceptance. You can print or save the T&Cs after reading
              them.
              CASCADE 8
              reserves the right to change the T&Cs at any time. In this case CASCADE 8 will inform any User when
              connecting itself
              to the Website for the first time after the modification of the T&Cs. Any User will have then to confirm
              its
              acceptance of the new T&Cs in order to access to the Service. Users who accept the T&Cs subject to
              reservations, or do
              not accept the T&Cs, cannot access the Website or use the Service. Any User can decide to close its
              profile
              at any
              time by clicking on “Delete my profile”. If a Company decides to close its own profile, all Users’
              profiles
              attached
              to it, will be automatically closed by CASCADE 8 at the same time. CASCADE 8 reserves the right to close
              or
              suspend
              the profile of any User who is in breach of its commitments under the T&Cs. In the event of suspension or
              closing, it
              is impossible for the User to access his profile, without prejudice to any other damages that CASCADE 8
              may
              claim.

              the
              maintenance operations required for the smooth functioning of the Platform and / or the Service, or the

              suppliers in
