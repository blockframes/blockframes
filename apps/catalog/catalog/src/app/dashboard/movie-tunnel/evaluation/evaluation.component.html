  <p description class="mat-body-1">
    If you wish, you can help us estimate your title's commercial value. We will not show this valuation to potentials buyers. We will only use it as a tool to fairly split revenues between titles for package deals.
    If you do not wish to do this valuation yourself, the Archipel team can do it for you.
    In any case, the final valuation will have to be validated between you and Archipel Content.
    If you have any questions about that, feel free to contact us and we'll be happy to clarify that for you.
